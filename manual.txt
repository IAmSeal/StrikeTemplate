Welcome to StrikeTemplate!

Please follow the checklist:

1. Read ALL of the lemlib and robodash documentation
    Lemlib: https://lemlib.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/index.html#
    Robodash: https://robodash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
2. Look through the chassis.cpp file and add your values
3. Go to opcontrol in main.cpp and add your mechs and stuff
4. Go to autons.cpp and make your autons
5. Ask me for help if you need it. If you don't know where
to find me, then you shouldn't have this template.
